It is difficult to carry a conversation in the reviews.  If you
have a question/bug-report/request please use the

that.  You are more likely to get a response and help that way.

_NOTE:_

**NOTE: This is unlike _DevTools_, as it is focus on only loading Zip files
instead of folders like _DevTools_.**  You still need _DevTools_ if
you actually want to do Plugin Development and to create _phar_ file
plugins.

This plugin lets you load plugins from zip files.  This is
particularly handy when trying out source plugins from
[GitHub](http://github.com) as you can click the **Download ZIP**
button, as you can then place the zip file in the plugins folder.

Essentially you put your plugin code in a zip file, and this plugin
will look for a **plugin.yml** file in there and load the plugin.

If there are multiple plugins in a zip file, all the plugins will be
loaded by default.  You can control what plugins will be loaded by
creating a control file.  For example if you have a:

	example.zip

You need to create a text file called:

	example.ctl

In this file you list (one plugin per line) the plugins that you want
to load.  Any plugins **not** in listed the control file will **not** be
loaded.
